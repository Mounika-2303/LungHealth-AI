# Respiratory Disorder Classification Using Lung Auscultation Sounds

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects and classifies respiratory disorders from lung auscultation sound files (.wav) using Deep Learning (CNN).  
It includes a Flask-based web application where users can upload lung sound recordings, visualize waveforms & MFCCs, and receive prediction results.

## 🎯 Purpose of Repository
- Centralized storage of code and resources
- Provides version control for tracking project progress
- Enables deployment-ready Flask web app
- Serves as a portfolio-ready project for academic and internship purposes
